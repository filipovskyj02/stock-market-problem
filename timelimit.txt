The time limit is the deciding factor in this problem - the naive solution is super simple and should not be accepted.
The naive solution takes linear time to answer each query, based on the size of the interval specified in the query.
The test data were designed around it so there is a huge number of queries with intervals spanning most of the price data points.
The correct solution uses a sparse table and the fact, that minimum is an overlap friendly function
to answer min-range queries in constant time.
Both solutions are included and can be used to determine the time limit.
For ilustration the sparse table solution takes ~ 3 seconds for AllInOne.txt, whereas the naive one takes around 2 minutes.
